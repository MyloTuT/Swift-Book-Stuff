//: Assertions
// An assertion is a runtime check that a Bool condition definitely evaluates to true.
// In some cases, it is simply not possible for your code to continue execution if a particluar condition is not satisfied. In these situations, you can trigger an assertion in your code to end code execution and to provide an opportunity to debug the cause of the absent or invalid value. 

//Debugging with Assertions

let age = -3
assert(age >= 0, "A person's age cannot be less than zero") //this causes the assertion to trigger, because age is not >= 0
